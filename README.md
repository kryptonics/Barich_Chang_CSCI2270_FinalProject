# Barich_Chang_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Summary:
  The project we are doing is creating a phone book where you can store contacts as well as add and delete them. We will also do functions like search and show contacts as well as save updates to the contacts. We will be using a binary search tree in this to organize and run these functions.
